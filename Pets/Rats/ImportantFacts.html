<ul>

<li>Rats are social creatures and I advice 
you to get a pair or group of the same sex, so that one won't get lonely.
Additionally, rats mate very quickly with 2 or more of different sex.
A female can be pregnant only 24 hours after giving birth.</li>
<li>They need cleaning out everyday</li>
<li>You need to change out the bedding and supplies in their cage weekly</li>
<li>Don't start holding them for the first one - two days when you have got them</li>
<li>Approach them kindly and make sure them aren't too upset</li>
<li>Never hold them too tightly</li>
<li>Register them for a vet as soon as possible</li>

</ul>
