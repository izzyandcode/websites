<p>They are adorable, loving creatures, who love to be petted and stroked, to play, eat and sleep. Most are brown, grey, white, black or a mix of those colours.
They have small, keen and black eyes, but terrible eyesight.<br> To make up for this disadvantage, they have an extremely good sense of smell and great hearing.
Rats are very intelligent creatures, this means they are good for training to do tricks.</p>
