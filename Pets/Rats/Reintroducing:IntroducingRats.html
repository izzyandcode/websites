<p>To reintroduce/introduce rats, you need a nutrial space, in this case a bath would be great.
The next step in to have one person watching the rats reactionss to eac other in the bath, whilst
you clean out the cage completely, so as to not leave on rat's smell and start a territorial fight 
afterwards. Finally, put the rats back in the cage with some treats to distract them from currently 
fighting.
